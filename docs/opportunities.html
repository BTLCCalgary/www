              <p>
                The primary role of board directors is to provide oversight and
                accountability to BTLC through effective governance. Our
                directors work together to support the Executive Director in
                achieving BTLC&apos;s mission through strategic planning, risk
                management, financial oversight, fundraising, and relationship
                building.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a small board, we are also a working board. Between meetings,
                directors contribute several hours a month individually and in
                small working groups on projects and tasks that support
                BTLC&apos;s mission and activities.
              </p>

              <p>
                Board meetings are held every two months for 1.5 to 2 hours,
                during the work week. We currently meet virtually.
              </p>

              <p>Board directors commit to a 2-year term.</p>
