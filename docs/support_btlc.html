            <p>
              With autism on the rise, the demand for services from BTLC is only
              expected to increase. Our hope is that we can build BTLC to be
              able to meet the demand, instead of building a longer waiting
              list.
            </p>

            <p>
              Unfortunately, the operating expenses are more than we receive
              from Alberta Education or PUF funding. Those of us involved with
              BTLC are also hoping to expand the school to a larger space and to
              older children – which will enable BTLC to offer more education to
              more children for a longer period of time. We are already seeing
              excellent results with our current students due to our specialized
              teaching approach and would love to see this grow.
            </p>

              all donations over $10.00.
